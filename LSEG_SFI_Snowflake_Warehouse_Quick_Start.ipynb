    "# LSEG's SFI Snowflake Datawarehouse: Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Quick Start article, we will investigate Public Companies' Climate Data on Snowflake. If you are interested in a more in-depth use-case, please read the \"LSEG's SFI Snowflake Datawarehouse: A use-case evaluating public companies' Climate track record using Python and SQL\" article that investigates the targets and whether they are on track to meet them; all while using data on LSEG's Sustainable Finance Investing (SFI) Snowflake.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSEG collects data from a range of sources; for climate data, we rely on our analysts to retrieve the information directly from companies disclosures. The most exciting data onboarded has, recently, related to ESG and Climate topics. From popular demand, we distribute Sustainable Finance and Investing (SFI) data via the Datawarehouse known as [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/). SFI Snowflake can be accessed via [Snowflake's online platform](https://app.snowflake.com/) or simply using Python via Snowflake's API wrapper named [Snowpark](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/index). Datasets available include ESG, Climate, EU Taxonomy and Green Revenues data. Snowflake's API is a [REST API](https://blog.postman.com/rest-api-examples/), just like LSEG's Data Platform; similarly, Snowflake created a module to wrap their API into the Python (as well as Scala and Java) module `snowpark` (in their Python library `snowflake`), just as we wrapped LSEG's Data Platform REST API into [LSEG's Data Library](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/lseg-data-platform/lseg-data-library-for-python) for Python. In this Quick Start, we will look into the Snowflake workflow up to 'Python Worksheets'; in total, there will be three topics: (i) Snowflake's Snowpark Python library, (ii) Snowflake SQL Worksheets and (iii) Snowflake Python Worksheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the data available on LSEG's SFI Snowflake, please look into [myaccount.lseg.com/en/product/quantitative-analytics](https://myaccount.lseg.com/en/product/quantitative-analytics). Here you will find all the related documentation necessary to understand the data-model we are tapping. Please be aware, while reading this documentation, that the SFI datasets are surfaced via the QA Quantitative Analytics (QA) product; LSEG collates several sets of data in tables in QA; some are packaged commercially-speaking under the name of 'Datastream', others under the name 'Worldscope', among these many packages, we are only interested in 'SFI' which is easy to access using Snowflake. When logging into [myaccount.lseg.com/en/product/quantitative-analytics](https://myaccount.lseg.com/en/product/quantitative-analytics), you can access PDF documentation files:"

One may believe that using the Snowpark Python library is easier than the Snowflake SQL Worksheets, or vice versa; and this really speaks volumes about the versatility of Snowflake, and the number of ways you can retrieve data in the manner that is most efficient for your workflow.\n",
